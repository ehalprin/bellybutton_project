# bellybutton_project

## Background of this Project

This project was initiated to provide information to participants in a research study. The research study was examining bacterial samples found in the bellybuttons of participants, to identify particular bacteria that may help flavor lab-grown meat. The dashboard shows each participant information on their bellybutton bacterial sample.
